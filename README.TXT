For running our pipeline open "Final.py" and change the source directory with your own folder.

"Adaptive-Huffman.py" , "RLE encoder.py" , "prediction_then_quantization.py" and "arithmetic 2.0.py" are not used in the pipeline but were implemented for comparison.

"2_img_.raw" is the picture used as reference for most comparisons in our report.
